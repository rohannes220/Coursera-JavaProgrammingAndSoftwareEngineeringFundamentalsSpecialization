## Data

- We are providing data on baby names from the United States.
- The data files give information on the first names of people born in a particular year.
- We have data from 1880 through 2014 on both boys and girls names.
- You can download a .zip folder of all baby name data by clicking [here](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/data/us_babynames.zip).
- The file lists all the girls first, and they are listed in order based on the number of births, from largest numbers to smallest numbers.
- Then all the boys are listed next in the order of number of births.
